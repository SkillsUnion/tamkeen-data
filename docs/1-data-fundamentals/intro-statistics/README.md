# Introduction to Statistics

Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of events occurring. It provides a framework for quantifying uncertainty and making informed decisions based on incomplete information. Understanding probability is essential in various fields, including statistics, finance, science, and engineering.

A **distribution** describes how probabilities are assigned to different outcomes in a random experiment. It provides a complete description of the random variable's behavior, indicating the likelihood of each possible outcome.

## Applications in Data Analytics and Data Science

- **Risk Assessment**: Probability helps in evaluating risks in various fields, such as finance and healthcare, allowing data analysts to make informed decisions based on potential outcomes.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Distributions are used to model and predict future events, enabling data scientists to create algorithms that forecast trends and behaviors.
- **A/B Testing**: Probability is essential in designing experiments to compare two or more variants, helping businesses optimize their strategies based on statistical significance.
- **Machine Learning**: Many machine learning algorithms rely on probability distributions to make predictions and classify data, enhancing the accuracy of models.
- **Data Cleaning**: Understanding distributions allows data scientists to fill missing values, identify outliers, and ensure data quality.
