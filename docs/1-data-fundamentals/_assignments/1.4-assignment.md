# Assignment: Data Foundation with Numpy

## Setup

First, import numpy and create the following arrays:

```python
import numpy as np

# Student test scores for 3 subjects (math, science, english)
scores = np.array([
    [85, 92, 78],
    [90, 88, 95],
    [75, 70, 85],
    [88, 95, 92],
    [65, 72, 68],
    [95, 88, 85],
    [78, 85, 82],
    [92, 89, 90]
])

# Student names
names = np.array(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve', 'Frank', 'Grace', 'Henry'])

# Random 4x4 matrix for linear algebra operations
matrix_A = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=(4, 4))
matrix_B = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=(4, 4))
```

## Tasks

1. Array Operations and Indexing

   - Calculate the average score for each student across all subjects
   - Find the highest score in each subject
   - Select all students who scored above 90 in any subject
   - Create a boolean mask to find students who passed all subjects (passing score is 70)

2. Array Manipulation

   - Reshape the scores array to be 12x2
   - Create a new array with standardized scores (subtract mean and divide by std dev)
   - Sort the students by their average score in descending order
   - Use array methods to find min, max and mean for each subject

3. Linear Algebra

   - Multiply matrix_A and matrix_B using matrix multiplication
   - Calculate the determinant of matrix_A
   - Find the inverse of matrix_A (if it exists)
   - Calculate the eigenvalues of matrix_A

4. Advanced Operations
   - Use broadcasting to add 5 points to all math scores (first column)
   - Find unique scores across all subjects
   - Use boolean indexing to find students who scored above average in all subjects

## Expected Format

Show your work with clear explanations. For each task, your output should look like:

```python
# Task 1.1: Average scores per student
average_scores = scores.mean(axis=1)
print("Average scores:", average_scores)
print("Students and their averages:")
for name, avg in zip(names, average_scores):
    print(f"{name}: {avg:.2f}")
```

## Bonus Challenge

Create a function that takes a student's name as input and returns:

- Their individual scores
- Their ranking in each subject
- A boolean indicating if they're in the top 3 performers overall

## Deliverable

Submit your solution as a Python script with:

1. All code clearly commented with
   1. Brief explanations of your approach for complex operations
   2. Any assumptions or additional features you implemented
2. Results for each task printed with appropriate labels

## Solutions

### 1. Array Operations and Indexing

```python
# 1.1 Average score for each student
avg_scores = scores.mean(axis=1)
print("Average scores per student:")
for name, avg in zip(names, avg_scores):
    print(f"{name}: {avg:.2f}")

# 1.2 Highest score in each subject
max_scores = scores.max(axis=0)
subjects = ['Math', 'Science', 'English']
print("\nHighest scores per subject:")
for subject, max_score in zip(subjects, max_scores):
    print(f"{subject}: {max_score}")

# 1.3 Students scoring above 90
high_scorers = names[np.any(scores > 90, axis=1)]
print("\nStudents with scores above 90:", high_scorers)

# 1.4 Students passing all subjects
passing_mask = np.all(scores >= 70, axis=1)
passing_students = names[passing_mask]
print("\nStudents passing all subjects:", passing_students)
```

### 2. Array Manipulation

```python
# 2.1 Reshape scores
reshaped_scores = scores.reshape(12, 2)
print("Reshaped scores:\n", reshaped_scores)

# 2.2 Standardized scores
standardized = (scores - scores.mean(axis=0)) / scores.std(axis=0)
print("\nStandardized scores:\n", standardized)

# 2.3 Sort by average score
sort_indices = avg_scores.argsort()[::-1]
sorted_names = names[sort_indices]
sorted_scores = scores[sort_indices]
print("\nStudents sorted by average score:")
for name, score in zip(sorted_names, sorted_scores):
    print(f"{name}: {score.mean():.2f}")

# 2.4 Statistics per subject
print("\nSubject statistics:")
for i, subject in enumerate(subjects):
    print(f"{subject}:")
    print(f"Min: {scores[:,i].min()}")
    print(f"Max: {scores[:,i].max()}")
    print(f"Mean: {scores[:,i].mean():.2f}")
```

### 3. Linear Algebra

```python
# 3.1 Matrix multiplication
matrix_product = np.matmul(matrix_A, matrix_B)
print("Matrix product:\n", matrix_product)

# 3.2 Determinant
det_A = np.linalg.det(matrix_A)
print("\nDeterminant of matrix_A:", det_A)

# 3.3 Matrix inverse
try:
    inv_A = np.linalg.inv(matrix_A)
    print("\nInverse of matrix_A:\n", inv_A)
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
    print("\nMatrix_A is not invertible")

# 3.4 Eigenvalues
eigenvals = np.linalg.eigvals(matrix_A)
print("\nEigenvalues of matrix_A:", eigenvals)
```

### 4. Advanced Operations

```python
# 4.1 Add 5 points to math scores
scores[:,0] += 5
print("Updated math scores:", scores[:,0])

# 4.2 Unique scores
unique_scores = np.unique(scores)
print("\nUnique scores:", unique_scores)

# 4.3 Above average in all subjects
subject_means = scores.mean(axis=0)
above_avg_mask = np.all(scores > subject_means, axis=1)
above_avg_students = names[above_avg_mask]
print("\nStudents above average in all subjects:", above_avg_students)
```

### Bonus Solution

```python
def student_analysis(student_name):
    # Find student index
    student_idx = np.where(names == student_name)[0][0]

    # Get scores
    student_scores = scores[student_idx]

    # Calculate rankings
    rankings = []
    for i in range(3):
        ranking = len(scores[:,i]) - np.searchsorted(np.sort(scores[:,i]), student_scores[i])
        rankings.append(ranking)

    # Check if in top 3
    avg_scores = scores.mean(axis=1)
    top_3 = np.argsort(avg_scores)[-3:]
    is_top_3 = student_idx in top_3

    return {
        'scores': student_scores,
        'rankings': rankings,
        'is_top_3': is_top_3
    }

# Example usage
result = student_analysis('Alice')
print("Analysis for Alice:", result)
```
