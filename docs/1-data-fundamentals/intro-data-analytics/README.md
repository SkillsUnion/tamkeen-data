# Introduction to Data Analytics and Data Science

## Overview

In today's data-driven world, understanding data analytics and data science is crucial for making informed decisions. This lesson will provide a comprehensive introduction to both fields, their methodologies, and their applications.

## What is Data Analytics?

Data analytics is the process of examining datasets to draw conclusions about the information they contain. It involves various techniques and tools to analyze data, uncover patterns, and make informed decisions.

### Types of Data Analytics

- **Descriptive Analytics**: Summarizes past data to understand what has happened.
- **Diagnostic Analytics**: Examines data to understand why something happened.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses statistical models to forecast future outcomes.
- **Prescriptive Analytics**: Recommends actions based on data analysis.

### Key Components of Data Analytics

1. **Data Sources**: Databases, APIs, and spreadsheets.
2. **Data Processing**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
3. **Data Analysis**: Employing statistical techniques to extract insights and identify trends within datasets.
4. **Data Visualization**: Tools like Tableau and Power BI to present data.
5. **Reporting**: Creating dashboards and reports for stakeholders.

## What is Data Science?

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines aspects of statistics, computer science, and domain expertise.

### Key Components of Data Science

- **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various sources.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preparing data for analysis by removing inaccuracies.
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzing data to find patterns and insights.
- **Modeling**: Creating algorithms to predict outcomes.
- **Deployment**: Implementing models in real-world applications.
