# Data Engineering Essentials

This unit covers data engineering essentials. You'll learn how to build a data pipeline, orchestrate via airflow and extract-load-transform (ELT) in a data warehouse.

1. **Data Pipeline Fundamentals**: Understand the basics of data pipelines and ETL processes.

   - Introduction to Data Engineering
   - ETL vs ELT Patterns
   - Types of Data Integration
   - Batch vs Stream Processing
   - Pipeline Architecture Patterns

2. **Pipeline Orchestration**: Learn core concepts and components of Apache Airflow.

   - Airflow Architecture Overview
   - DAGs and Operators
   - Tasks and Dependencies

3. **Advanced Airflow**: Dive deeper into Airflow features and best practices.

   - Variables and Connections
   - Scheduling and Triggers
   - Sensors and Hooks
   - Airflow CLI and UI

4. **Deploying Airflow with Astronomer**: Deploying and managing Airflow pipelines using Astronomer.

   - Astronomer Platform Overview
   - Astronomer CLI
   - DAG Deployment

5. **Data Warehouse Architecture**

   - Schema Design Patterns
   - Dimensional Modeling
   - Slowly Changing Dimensions
   - Partitioning Strategies
