# What is JavaScript

JavaScript bears no resembalancee to the language `Java`, other than some superficial syntax similarities to a shared ancestor language, `C`. THe name was mostly a marketing descision.

It was famously created in about a week by Brendan Eich, who was working at the first browser company, _Netscape_.

JavaScript is not a terribly well-regarded language, but has become popular because it is the **only** language of the web browser. Any and every single web browser created must run the JavaScript language, which has made it a powerhouse in terms of ubiquity. In fact it's relatively rare for a signle language to dominate a such a diverse and wide spread platform such as the web browser.
